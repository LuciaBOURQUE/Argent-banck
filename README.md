# Argent Bank ðŸ’²

13's project of Openclassrooms

Argent Bank is a banking application in which customers can log in and manage their accounts and profile.
The goal of the exercise here is to design the responsive interface of the application by working with Redux state management, in particular to manage user authentication; connection/disconnection to the system, overview of customer information as well as modification of their data if necessary.
The API Backend is provided by the team where all Swagger documentation is inside the repo.
